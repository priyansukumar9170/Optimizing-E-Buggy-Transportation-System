# Optimizing-E-Buggy-Transportation-System 🚖 

📌 **Project Overview**

The current e-buggy transportation system at IIT Bombay lacks optimization, leading to long waiting times, route inefficiencies, and mismatched demand-supply during peak academic hours. This project aims to enhance the e-buggy system by optimizing routes, scheduling, and assignments, ensuring better accessibility and reduced travel time for students.

🎯 **Problem Statement**

✔ High waiting times for students due to an imbalance in e-buggy availability.

✔ Inefficient routing causing unnecessary delays and congestion.

✔ Mismatched scheduling with academic hours, leading to demand-supply gaps.

🚀 **Objective**

**Optimize the e-buggy system to:**

🔹 Minimize travel time by reducing waiting & transit times.

🔹 Optimize routes by covering multiple hostels efficiently.

🔹 Improve scheduling to match academic peak hours.

🏗 **Methodology**

This problem was tackled using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to develop an optimized transportation model.

🔹 1️⃣ Travel Time Minimization
Modeled waiting & travel times for each buggy.
Optimized scheduling to reduce delays and congestion.

🔹 2️⃣ Route Optimization
Designed shortest, non-redundant routes.
Ensured each e-buggy covers at least two hostels per trip.

🔹 3️⃣ Scheduling & Assignment
Matched e-buggy availability with peak demand.
Assigned multiple routes per buggy based on need.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**

🔹 Python 🐍

🔹 PuLP – Linear programming solver 📊

🔹 NetworkX – Graph-based route optimization 🌐

🔹 NumPy & Pandas – Data processing 📑

🔹 Matplotlib – Visualization 📈

**🚀 Results & Impact**

✔ Reduced waiting times for students.

✔ Optimized route planning, minimizing unnecessary detours.

✔ More efficient e-buggy allocation, improving accessibility.
